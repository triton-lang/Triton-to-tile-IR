# EXPORTS format description
# format = name [exclusion_list | inclusion_list]
# exclusion_list = -flag
# inclusion_list = +flag
#
# All flags are case-insensitive.
# Built in flags are: [+|-]win, [+|-]linux, [+|-]mac
# If flags are omitted, exports will be included to def file for all three platforms (win, linux, mac).
# If flags exist, script will check if appropriate environment variables are set:
#     - for exclusion (-), if flag exists and environment variable with the same name is set to 1, name is excluded
#     - for inclusion (+), if flag exists and environment variable with the same name is set to 1, name is included
# Exclusion (-) has higher priority than inclusion (+).
# If two or more flags exist, it is enough for one of them to be set for exclusion/inclusion to be done
# For example:
#    clGetPlatformInfo                       +win +linux
#    cuGLMapBufferObjectAsync                -nv_opencl_use_icd
# clGetPlatformInfo will be included if one or both of the "win" and "linux" variables is/are set.
# cuGLMapBufferObjectAsync will be excluded if either "gwc" or "nv_opencl_use_icd" is set.

# In this section DLL exports and flags should be specified
